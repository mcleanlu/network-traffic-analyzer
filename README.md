# Overview

I used the Rust programming language to create a network speed test program for this assignment. The goal of this software was to show that I understood the syntax of Rust and to advance my education as a software developer.

Through the establishment of a TCP connection with a server and the simulation of a download, the software enables users to gauge the download speed of their network. Based on the volume of data downloaded and the amount of time that has passed, it determines the download speed in megabits per second (Mbps).

On my YouTube channel, you can see a 4-5 minute tutorial of the code and a demonstration of the software in action. The video gives an overview of the software's functionality, emphasizes key sections of the code, and presents my thoughts on the Rust programming language.

# Development Environment

During the development of this software, I used the following tools:

Operating System: Windows 10
Integrated Development Environment (IDE): Visual Studio Code
Rust programming language: Version 1.69.0

# Future Work

Although the software is functional, there are several areas where improvements and additions could be made:

- Implement additional features, such as the ability to measure upload speed and latency.
- Add error handling and graceful error messages for various scenarios.
- Enhance the user interface with better input validation and interactive prompts.
- Improve code organization and modularity for better maintainability.
- Optimize the network speed test algorithm for more accurate results.
- Expand the software to support multiple server connections for comparative speed testing.
- By addressing these points, the software can be enhanced to provide a more comprehensive network speed testing experience.
